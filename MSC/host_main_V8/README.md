This file contains all of the coding that was modified from the USB-MSC device example. The modified code includes:

main/CMakeLists

tusb_msc_main.c

and potentially c_cpp_properties.json

To verify code, modify the main/CmakeLists and tusb_msc_main.c as required. If it does not build, then change the c_cpp_properties.json with the correct corresponding paths.
